## üìù Detailed Script

### üéØ Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Title slide with SourceSense logo]**

**Narrator**: "Welcome to the SourceSense PostgreSQL Connector demo. I'm going to show you a comprehensive metadata extraction application built with the Atlan Apps Framework that extracts and displays schema information, business context, lineage information, and quality metrics from PostgreSQL databases."

**[Screen: Application overview diagram]**

**Narrator**: "This application demonstrates enterprise-grade metadata extraction capabilities with a modern web interface, real-time workflow orchestration, and comprehensive data analysis."

---

### üöÄ Application Demo (3 minutes)

#### Part 1: Application Startup (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal showing application startup]**

**Narrator**: "Let's start by launching the application. I'll start the PostgreSQL database, populate it with sample data, and then launch the web interface."

```bash
# Show these commands
docker-compose up -d
uv run python simple_populate.py
uv run main.py
```

**[Screen: Web interface at localhost:8000]**

**Narrator**: "The application is now running with a clean, modern web interface. You can see we have a multi-step form for metadata extraction."

#### Part 2: Database Connection (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Connection step of the form]**

**Narrator**: "First, let's test the database connection. The form is pre-configured with our PostgreSQL database settings."

**[Click "Test Connection" button]**

**Narrator**: "Perfect! The connection is successful. You can see the database details including host, port, and database name."

#### Part 3: Metadata Discovery (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Metadata step with dropdowns]**

**Narrator**: "Now let's discover the available metadata. The application has automatically detected our sample database with multiple schemas."

**[Show dropdowns populated with data]**

**Narrator**: "We have the 'sample_db' database with 'analytics' and 'ecommerce' schemas. This is a realistic e-commerce database with over 2,000 products, 500 users, and thousands of related records."

**[Demonstrate include/exclude filtering]**

**Narrator**: "I can filter which schemas to include or exclude from the extraction. For this demo, I'll include both schemas to show the full scope of metadata extraction."

#### Part 4: Workflow Execution (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Preflight checks and workflow start]**

**Narrator**: "The preflight checks validate our configuration. Now let's start the metadata extraction workflow."

**[Click "Start Workflow" button]**

**Narrator**: "The workflow is now running. You can see the real-time progress updates as different activities complete. This is powered by Temporal workflow orchestration."

**[Screen: Progress updates]**

**Narrator**: "The workflow is extracting database metadata, schema information, table details, column information, foreign keys, and data quality metrics. Each activity runs independently and can be retried if needed."

#### Part 5: Results Display (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Workflow completion and results]**

**Narrator**: "The workflow has completed successfully! Let's examine the extracted metadata to see what we've discovered."

**[Screen: Terminal showing metadata results]**

```bash
uv run python view_metadata.py
```

**Narrator**: "Here we can see comprehensive metadata including database statistics, schema information, table details with row counts and sizes, column information with data types and constraints, and foreign key relationships."

### üîß Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)

#### Part 1: Architecture Overview (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram]**

**Narrator**: "Let me show you the technical architecture. The application is built on the Atlan Apps Framework with several key components:"

- **FastAPI Backend**: REST API for web interface
- **Temporal Workflows**: Orchestrates metadata extraction activities
- **PostgreSQL Handler**: Database-specific metadata extraction logic
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Containerized PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend JavaScript**: Real-time web interface

**[Screen: Code showing handler implementation]**

**Narrator**: "The PostgreSQL handler extends the base SQL handler with PostgreSQL-specific SQL queries. Notice how we handle PostgreSQL's unique information_schema behavior and field naming requirements."

#### Part 2: Key Technical Decisions (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Code showing SQL query]**

**Narrator**: "One key technical decision was handling PostgreSQL's column aliasing requirements. We use a subquery approach to ensure compatibility with the framework's expected field names."

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    t.table_catalog AS catalog_name,
    t.table_schema AS schema_name
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE t.table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema', 'pg_toast')
ORDER BY t.table_catalog, t.table_schema
```

**[Screen: Workflow code]**

**Narrator**: "The workflow orchestrates multiple activities in sequence, with proper error handling and retry logic. Each activity can fail independently without affecting the entire workflow."

**[Screen: Frontend JavaScript]**

**Narrator**: "The frontend uses modern JavaScript with async/await patterns for real-time updates and progress monitoring."

#### Part 3: Metadata Extraction Capabilities (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Metadata results breakdown]**

**Narrator**: "The application extracts comprehensive metadata including:"

- **Schema Information**: Column names, data types, constraints, indexes
- **Business Context**: Table descriptions, relationships, domain organization
- **Lineage Information**: Foreign key relationships, data dependencies
- **Quality Metrics**: Row counts, table sizes, performance statistics

**[Screen: Sample metadata output]**

**Narrator**: "This data is stored in Parquet format for efficient processing and can be easily integrated with Atlan's data catalog."

### üöß Challenges & Solutions (1 minute)

#### Part 1: Database Compatibility (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Error handling code]**

**Narrator**: "One major challenge was PostgreSQL's unique SQL syntax. Unlike other databases, PostgreSQL doesn't allow column aliases in GROUP BY clauses directly."

**[Screen: Solution code]**

**Narrator**: "We solved this by using DISTINCT with subqueries and proper field name aliasing to ensure compatibility with the Atlan Apps Framework."

#### Part 2: Frontend-Backend Integration (30 seconds)

**[Screen: API integration code]**

**Narrator**: "Another challenge was real-time frontend-backend integration. We implemented polling-based progress updates and comprehensive error handling to provide a smooth user experience."

**[Screen: Error handling in frontend]**

**Narrator**: "The frontend gracefully handles connection failures, workflow errors, and provides clear feedback to users throughout the process."
